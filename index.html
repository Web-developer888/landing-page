	<h2>Landing page concept</h2>
	<p>
		A landing page is a dedicated webpage crafted specifically for marketing or advertising campaigns, where users "land" after clicking on an ad, email, or link. Unlike a homepage or other pages on a website, a landing page has one clear goal: to drive a specific action from the visitor, such as signing up for a newsletter, downloading a product guide, or making a purchase. This single focus helps increase conversion rates, as the page is designed to minimize distractions and direct users toward a single call-to-action (CTA).
		</p>
		<p>
			Effective landing pages are structured with key elements to maximize engagement. A clear, attention-grabbing headline is essential to immediately convey the value proposition and keep visitors interested. Supporting copy provides brief, persuasive information that reinforces the offer and explains how it benefits the visitor. Visuals, like product images or demonstration videos, can also enhance the message and make the page more engaging. Finally, a prominent CTA button, often brightly colored and strategically placed, encourages visitors to take the desired action, such as “Get Started” or “Claim Your Discount.” By aligning content with the audience's needs and simplifying the user experience, landing pages effectively guide visitors toward conversions.
